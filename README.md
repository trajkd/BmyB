# Book To Book
Book To Book is a subscription based book-sharing website I'm working on.
## Walkthrough
The book catalog can be accessed from the homepage.

Clicking on a cover shows specific details of the book.

## TODO: Further implementation
Future versions will give users who register to the website the ability to book their books for a specific time period at their location.
